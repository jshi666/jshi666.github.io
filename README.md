# jshi666.github.io

In this project, I created three html pages, a personal index page, a biography page, and a resume page. Each html page has it's own CSS file for styling purposes. The index page includes two links to the other two pages and there's a "return to homepage button" on the bio and resume page. 

All files including the directories are in my speical repo jshi666.github.io and I've commited my work with meaningful messages. CSS stylesheets used more than 5 rules. All pages passed the W3C validator test. 

I referred to the html pages and css stylesheets used in class as examples when I'm working on the assignment. Additionally, I looked at Ming's personal website for styling inspiration. The pictures used on the webpage are all found on google images. Citations are at the bottom of this file. 

I spent approximately 7 hours completing both the git lab and the assignment.
