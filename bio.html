	<h1>Me in my own words</h1>
	<p>I was born and raised in Beijing, China, and came to the US to pursue my undergraduate studies. I've actually never visited Tufts or Boston before coming here but now i'm completely in love with this city. Despite going into finance after graudation, my dream is still opening a cool restaurant and bar later in life! </p>
